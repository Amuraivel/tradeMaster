# Overview and Introduction

Trade Master is a high-level framework to rapidly test and develop multi-asset option-based  long-short portfolio strategies.

It consists of four layers: 
1. a management layer written in Python to handle data, construct option objects, etc.
2. an analytics layer written in R to perform analytics and handle the high-level prototyping such as choice of entry, exits, portfolio anlytics, etc.
3. a pricing layer written in C++ and OpenCL to allow fast computation and parallel computing.
4. a visualization layer using Shiny to spot opportunities
